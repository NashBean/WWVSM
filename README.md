World Wide Virtual Shopping Mall

This is the start of a online shopping mall.

Where our goal will be to create the best, virtual, online, shopping mall in world.
New venders would rent a store front for 1% of sales, and gain safe online transaction, with any world currency.
With a small inital set up fee, 99% of wich would pay services of and online employ to help get there store up and running.

Allowing venders to upgrade their store as they please. With updates including, but not limited to the following:
- Bigger store front, more item displays, bigger name, logo,...
- more item displays in store, wall space, floor stace, shelves, signs.
- add signs in other parts of the mall, that gets more traffic.
- The venders could also sponser an attraction to be put in front of their store front. water fall, 3D live band, game room, tree, diminstation of product, place to sit, garden,  ...
- The venders could also sponser an attraction to be put in their store like above.
- ...

Allowing vistors(someone that has not set up a pay account) to walk arount and look at sights and store fronts, without mall transportation or going into a store.

Allowing shoppers(someone that has set up a pay account) to ride arount and look at sights, with mall transportation.

All this and more could be done fast with the help of other programmers and using mine craft code, to start the mall foundation.
